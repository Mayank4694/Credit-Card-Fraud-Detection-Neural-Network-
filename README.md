# Fraud Detection Model (Credit Card Scams)

## About the Dataset
In this kernel we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. The features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!

## Goal:
1. EDA of Fraud Transactions
2. Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions(NearMiss Algorithm).
3. Check Classifiers with best accuracy in Fraud Detection.
4. Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
5. Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.

## Results

Best results are given by Extra Tree Regressor model and RandomUnderSampling
